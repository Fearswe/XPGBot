# XPGBot

### Description
The bot is mainly used for XPGaming Discord to add commands for checking game server statuses.

### Usage
You can type either of the following commands (they all do the same), followed by the name of the game/server:
* !server
* !status
* !game

To get a list of games/servers, just type anything after the command that doesn't exist.

### Setup
Fill in the servers as set by the botconfig.json.example file.
Don't forget you also must add your discord token to it.

### Misc
Uses the following libraries
* [DiscordJS](https://discord.js.org/#/)
* [GameDig](https://github.com/gamedig/node-gamedig#readme)

Check those for list of compatible games as well as how to customize the discord messages or add functionality.
